## Description

For our final project we're planning to create a space-shooter style game using Unity, with SuperCollider for audio. The game is inspired by Treasure Planet & Spacewar. The game starts out with a kid in a bedroom dreaming of being a space-fighter, and then he opens a door into space and begins fighting against enemies, which include asteroids and gravity-wells that distort space.

## To-Do
